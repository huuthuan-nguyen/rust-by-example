# rust-by-example
I'm learning Rustlang which is the new programming language, so this repository is used for tracking my learning progress.

Actually, this is the first step of my learning curve in Blockchain programming. The main purpose of Rustlang is used for Blockchain development.

After spent 8 hours at company and 1 hour and a half for daily commute. I decided to spend 30 minutes a day learning Rustlang. I hope next year I could become a Blockchain developer and my salary will be raised too.

- After spending 4 months with slowly learning, I realize that Rust should be used with Go as companion. I will continue with Rust for next 2 months. Then I will revisit this `README.md` again. There is a lot of works in my company, I have to prioritize them first.
